# Background

IMDb is an online database, owned by Amazon, of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online – including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews.

For the today's analysis, we use a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

The dataset consists of the following variable: Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

* `title`: Movie title
* `genre`: Movie genre
* `director`: Movie director
* `year`: Year the movie was published
* `duration`: Duration of the movie
* `gross`: The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
* `budget`: The movie's budget 
* `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast members received
* `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
* `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
* `rating`: IMDB average rating


# Load packages

```{r load-libraries}
library(tidyverse)# Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(kableExtra)# show the result in table format
```


# Import data

```{r,load_movies}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))

```


# Cleaning the data

We need to check whether there is missing data or duplicate data.

```{r glimpse_skim_data2}

# Checking for missing values
anyNA(movies)

# Checking if there are duplicates based on title, director, year, duration
dupes <- movies %>%
  select(title, director, year, duration) %>%
  duplicated()

#check the number of duplcate rows
table(dupes)["TRUE"]

#get the clean dataset
movies_cleaned <- movies[!dupes,]

```

> There are no missing values (NAs) in the dataset. Equally, there are no duplicate rows (= identical for each column) but there is a total of **54** duplicate rows based on titles, director, year and movie duration. The duplicates differ on the number of votes and thus the rating. For the following analysis we removed the second occurrence of each duplicate.


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the [R4DS Exploratory Data Analysis chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html), the authors state:

> “Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation…EDA is fundamentally a creative process. And like most creative processes, the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions.”


## How many movies in each genre?

```{r}

# count the number of movies using group_by function
movies_by_genre <- movies_cleaned %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  count(sort = TRUE)

# show the result in table
movies_by_genre %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Genre", "Movie count")) %>%
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)

```

From the table, we could know that in this dataset, we have the most comedy movies and the least thriller movies. We could also show the data in a plot format.

```{r, question2, fig.width=12}

# count the number of movies using group_by function
movies_by_genre %>%   
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(genre,n), y = n))+
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue")+
  labs(title = "How many movies in each genre?",
       x = "genre",
       y = "number of movies")+
  theme_classic()
```

## Which kind of movies is the most profitable?

```{r, question3}
genre_gross_budget <- movies_cleaned %>%
  mutate(return_on_budget = gross/budget) %>% # add a new variable named return on budget
  group_by(genre) %>% # remember group_by function could be followed by summarize but not mutate
  summarize(mean_gross = mean(gross)/1000000, 
            mean_budget = mean(budget)/1000000, 
            mean_return = mean(return_on_budget)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_return)) # change the order

# use the table format to present them
genre_gross_budget %>% 
  kbl(col.names = c("Genre", "Mean Gross (mm)", "Mean Budget (mm)", "Mean Return"), digits = 2) %>%
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)
```

> This table shows that the most profitable movies are by far horror movies. This genre could be considered as an outlier since it is on average 4 times more profitable than the second on the list, which is Biography. Conversely, the least profitable genre is “Thriller” and it is unexpectedly low. However, it would not be relevant to assert that it is not a profitable genre, since there is only 1 thriller movie in our data frame. As a rule of thumb, we could assume that it would be difficult to conclude without a significant sample size of at least n=30 movies. Hence,  we will not comment on which genre is the least profitable one, but it is fair to conclude that horror movies are indeed very profitable.


## How is the ratings distribution for each genre?

```{r, question5}
# calculate indicators for movies' rating
genre_ratings <- movies_cleaned %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarize(Minimum_Rating = min(rating), Max_Rating = max(rating), 
            Mean_Rating = mean(rating), Median_Rating = median(rating), 
            st_dev=sd(rating)) 

genre_ratings %>%
  kbl(col.names = gsub("[_]", " ", names(genre_ratings))) %>%
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)
```
Except for showing them in table, we could also show them in a density plot.

```{r, question6}
# present data in density plot
ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating, group = genre)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = F, fill = 'lightblue') +
  labs(title = "Density distribution of ratings by genre", x = "Rating", y = "Density") +
  facet_wrap(~genre) + # split them into different plot based on genre
  theme_clean()
```

> It is interesting to notice that while horror  movies were the most profitable ones, they are also the most disliked movies (after the thriller movie which represents an unsignificant sample). Conversely, Biography movies are the most liked ones and are also very profitable. Perhaps movies are a great source of inspiration, and while there is no dearth of good fictional movies, what really inspires people are biographies.


## Who is the top10 directors?

```{r, question4}
top_directors <- movies_cleaned %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(gross)/1000000, mean = mean(gross)/1000000,
            median = median(gross)/1000000, st_dev=sd(gross)/1000000) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(10)

top_directors %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Director", "Total Revenue (mm)", "Mean Revenue (mm)", 
                    "Median Revenue (mm)", "SD of Revenue (mm)"), digits = 2) %>%
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)
```
Now, we have top10 directors'data. In project2 [IMDB-2](), we will do move analysis.


# Graphical descriptive analysis based on `ggplot`

Descriptive statistics can be useful for two purposes:

- to provide basic information about variables in a dataset
- to highlight potential relationships between variables. 

The three most common descriptive statistics can be displayed graphically or pictorially and are measures of: Graphical/Pictorial Methods.


## Relationship between facebook likes and gross sales of a movie

```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = cast_facebook_likes, y = gross)) +
  labs(title= "Relationship between facebook likes and \ngross sales of a movie", x = "# Likes", y = "Gross ($)") +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_clean()

#Correlation coefficient
movies %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(cast_facebook_likes,gross)^2)

```

> There is no direct relationship between the number of facebook likes and the gross sales of a movie which may likely be due to the fact that movies are not primarily promoted though individual facebook pages. The R squared is 0.0454, indicating no significant correlation between the two variables. 


## Relationship between budget and gross sales of a movie

```{r, gross_on_budget}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = budget, y = gross)) +
  labs(title= "Relationship between budget and gross sales of a movie", x = "Budget ($)", y = "Gross ($)") +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  theme_clean()


#Correlation coefficient
movies %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(budget,gross)^2)

```

> A relationship between the movie budget and the gross sales of a movie can be inferred. There is a clear correlation between a higher budget and a resulting higher likelihood for commercial success in terms of gross sales.


## Relationship IMDB rating and gross sales of a movie

```{r, gross_on_rating, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating, y = gross)) +
  labs(title= "Relationship between IMDB rating\nand gross sales of a movie", x = "IMDB Rating", y = "Gross ($)") +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  theme_clean()
```

> The data indicates that a higher IMDB rating is a somewhat indicator for higher gross sales in the categories of action, adventure, animation, biography and drama. This may likely be due to higher budget requirements in terms of cast, special effects and post production. As the general trajectory that can be observed in relatively flat across the other categories, IMDB rating is only (if at all) a limited factor in explaining variance in gross sales. Furthermore, the dataset might be missing information for movies in the categories musical, romance, thriller and western. Hence, it is not possible to infer any conclusion on the correlation between IMDB Rating and gross sales for those categories.


Next project, we are going to explore more on the director dataset to find out whether the mean IMDB rating for directors are same or not.
